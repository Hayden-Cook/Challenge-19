# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description
This week, I built a text editor that operates in the browser. It is a single-page application that is considered a PWA, or progressive web application. This application features data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case of the options is not supported by the browser being used. This application also has the capability to function offline.
